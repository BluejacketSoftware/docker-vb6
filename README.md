This repo provides the recipe for creating a docker image with VS6 installed under wine, so you can build vb6 projects in gitlab-ci or whatever. I don't know, whatever purpose you might have for it.

Anyway.. This repo will never have an image placed on docker hub or any other public image registry (at least, not by me, because I don't fancy getting cease & desisted by MSFT). BYOVS6
